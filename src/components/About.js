        <p>
          My name is Idzel Jaimes, I'm 33, and I'm a self-taught Full-Stack Web
          Developer.
          <br></br>
          I've recently completed a Full-Stack coding bootcamp certification
          with the University of Texas at Austin.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          When I'm not practicing code, I am knee deep in my garden.
          <br></br>
          I'm a very hands on person and love to see my hard work comes to
          fruition.
          <br></br>
          There's just something exciting about watching a seed grow into
          something spectacular!
